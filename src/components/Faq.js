                  Yes, you can. Just open the parent app (Surfie-Parent) and tab
                  the disconnect button on the bottom of the Family Overview
                  screen. If you want to disconnect just some of your children,
                  then select the disconnect button on the relevant profiles.

                  and Facebook cyber-bullying alerts, location tracking and
                  location alerts and website filtering. In the new future we
                  will also introduce app-usage tracking for iOS devices (as we
